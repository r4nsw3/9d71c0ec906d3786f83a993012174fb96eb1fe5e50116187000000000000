  |   The Red Strings Club is a cyberpunk narrative experience about fate   |
  |   and happiness featuring the extensive use of pottery, bartending      |
  |   and impersonating people on the phone to take down a corporate        |
  |   conspiracy.                                                           |

  |   The professed altruistic corporation Supercontinent Ltd is on the     |
  |   verge of releasing Social Psyche Welfare: a system that will          |
  |   eliminate depression, anger and fear from society. However, the       |
  |   bartender of a clandestine club and a freelance hacker don't regard   |
  |   this evolution as an improvement but as brainwashing. Alongside       |
  |   unwitting company employees and a rogue empathy android, the duo      |
  |   will pull all the strings they can to bring down this scheme.         |
  |                                                                         |
